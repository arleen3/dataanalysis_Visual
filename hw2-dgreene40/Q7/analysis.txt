1.Ease to Develop 
	Excel: Very easy to use and it has been around for a while.
	Tableau: This tool is new to me but I liked it and found a little bit more 			 difficult than Excel.
	Python: Many available libraries at our disposition. I can program better in 	 		Python than in Javascript.
	D3: You can do amazing things with this tool but there is a learning curve, 			especially if you don't know Javascript. 
2.Ease to maintain the visualization
	Excel: This is the easiest tool to maintain the visualizations but it is 			not the most diverse nor versatil. 
	Tableau: More robust than Excel and I felt it is not as tedious as D3 to maintain.
	D3: 	It allows to change of data for domains and new graph rendering once you 		learn D3 more in depth.
	Python: Slightly more difficult than D3 but at least no Javascript is required to 		create visualizations.
